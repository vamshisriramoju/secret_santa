Secret Santa Generator

A Secret Santa Generator built with Node.js and Express that assigns Secret Santa pairs for participants. 
It avoids pairing partners together and sends an email to each participant with their Secret Santa assignment.

Features

Random Pairing: Randomly assigns each participant a Secret Santa, ensuring no participant is paired with their own partner.
Email Notifications: Automatically sends an email to each participant with their assigned Secret Santa.
Couple Handling: Allows you to specify partners (couples) to ensure they are not paired with each other.

Node.js installed on your system
Gmail account for sending emails or another email provider (configurable)
